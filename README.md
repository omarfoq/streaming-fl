# Federated Learning for Data Streams
This repository is the official implementation of
[Federated Learning for Data Streams](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.01542)

Federated learning (FL) is an effective solution to train machine
learning models on the increasing amount of data generated by IoT
devices and smartphones while keeping such data localized.
Most previous work on federated learning assumes that clients
operate on static datasets collected before training starts.
This approach may be inefficient because 1) it ignores new
samples clients collect during training, and 2) it may require
a potentially long preparatory phase for clients to collect enough
data. Moreover, learning on static datasets may be simply impossible
in scenarios with small aggregate storage across devices.
It is, therefore, necessary to design federated algorithms
able to learn from data streams. In this work, we formulate
and study the problem of federated learning for data
streams. We propose a general FL algorithm to learn from data
streams through an opportune weighted empirical risk minimization.
Our theoretical analysis provides insights to configure such an
algorithm, and we evaluate its performance on a wide range of
machine learning tasks.
